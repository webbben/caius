# In Progress

- Web Search
  - implement a feature to search the web and summarize results for a given search phrase

# Paused

- "Compressing" lower level directory info to improve effectiveness of AnalyzeDirectory
  - The idea here is that, currently, there may be too many files considered during AnalyzeDirectory, lowering the accuracy of the overall analysis.
  - If we do some pre-processing of lower level directories, then in the final analysis we will have more "focused" information that's easier to analyze by the LLM.
